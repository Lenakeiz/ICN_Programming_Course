    "A **branch** in Git is like a parallel timeline of your project.  \n",
    "- By default, every repository starts with a single branch (often called `main`).  \n",
    "- You can create a new branch to experiment, add features, or fix bugs **without changing the main branch**.  \n",
    "- Later, you can merge the branch back into `main` once you‚Äôre happy with the changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes branches very useful for:  \n",
    "- Working on new features safely, without breaking the main project.  \n",
    "- Trying out experiments that you might throw away later.  \n",
    "- Collaborating with others: each person can work on their own branch and merge changes when ready.  \n",
