    "### 1. Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the same piece of code multiple times, you can make use of a `for` loop. \n",
    "This will execute whatever code is held within the `for` block.\n",
    "That is, the loop counter variable ('count' in the example below) is initialised at some value (0 in the example below), and the code within the indented block is then executed 'for' that value, then the loop counter variable moves on to the next value in list of values that have been assigned to it, and the code is executed again, and so on, until the loop counter variable reaches the last value that has been assigned to it (10, in the example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python specifically:**\n",
    "- Use `range(start, stop, step)` for basic counted loops (note: `stop` is *exclusive*).\n",
    "  - `range(stop)`: 0 up to (but not including) `stop`.\n",
    "  - `range(start, stop)`: `start` up to (but not including) `stop`.\n",
    "  - `range(start, stop, step)`: as above, advancing by `step`.\n",
    "- Use `enumerate(sequence, start=0)` when you need both the index *and* the element while iterating. It yields `(index, item)` pairs; set `start` to change the starting index.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `for` loops to iterate over sequences, such as lists or numpy arrays. However depending on the case using fancy indexing (discussed earlier) might be a more efficient solution.\n"
