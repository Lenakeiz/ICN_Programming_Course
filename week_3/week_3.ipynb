    "You can remove key-value pairs from a dictionary using the `del` keyword followed by the dictionary name and the key in square brackets.\n",

    "Alternatively, you can use the `.pop()` method, which removes the item with the specified key and returns its value. This can be useful if you need to use the removed value.\n",
