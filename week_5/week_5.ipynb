    "## Working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting your experiments results are typically stored in files. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A text file (.txt) may contain timestamps of neuronal spikes, each recorded on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A CSV file (.csv) may contain structured data such as subject IDs, ages, conditions, and behavioural accuracy across trials.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Specific formats that depends on the information you have recorded (fMRI, EEG, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to read data from files is then the starting step from any analysis pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly when running an experiment you will need to write back data into files for saving your analysis outputs—so that you or other researchers can check, share, and build on your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a file\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic way to open a file in Python is using the `open()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first argument** is the file name (e.g. `\"example.txt\"`).  \n",
    "  - This can be a **relative path** (just the file name, if the file is in the same folder as your script).  \n",
    "  - Or it can be a **full (absolute) path**, for example:  \n",
    "    - On Windows:  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      file = open(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Andrea\\\\Documents\\\\data\\\\example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      *(note the double backslashes)*  \n",
    "    - On macOS/Linux:  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      file = open(\"/Users/andrea/Documents/data/example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **second argument** is the *mode*, which tells Python what you want to do with the file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Meaning | Notes |\n",
    "|------|---------|-------|\n",
    "| `'r'` | Read | Default mode. Opens the file for reading. Fails if the file doesn’t exist. |\n",
    "| `'w'` | Write | Creates a new empty file or overwrites an existing one. |\n",
    "| `'a'` | Append | Opens a file for writing, but adds content to the end (does not erase existing data). |\n",
    "| `'x'` | Create | Creates a new file. Fails if the file already exists. |\n",
    "| `'r+'` | Read and Write | Opens an existing file for both reading and writing. |"

    "\n",

    "- **File locks**: some operating systems prevent other programs from accessing a file while it is open \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, Python provides a convenient structure called a **context manager**, used with the `with` statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file inside a `with` block:  \n",
    "- The file is automatically **closed** as soon as the block finishes, even if an error occurs inside the block.  \n",
    "- This makes your code shorter, cleaner, and less error-prone compared to manually calling `file.close()`.  \n"
