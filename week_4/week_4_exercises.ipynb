    "## [1] Analysing spike times\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to write a function called `analyze_spike_data` that takes a list of spike times as input (in seconds) and returns a dictionary containing key metrics of key firing statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define the function:** Create a function named `analyze_spike_data` that accepts one argument: `spike_times` as a numpy array of spikes detected in certain time window.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Metrics:** Inside the function, calculate the following:\n",
    "    *   `num_spikes`: The total number of spikes\n",
    "    *   `duration`: The total duration of the recording. Assume the recording starts at the time of the first spike and ends at the time of the last spike. If there are fewer than 2 spikes, the duration is 0.\n",
    "    *   `average_isi`: The average of the inter-spike intervals. Inter-spike intervals are calculated as a list of time difference between consecutive spikes. If there are fewer than 2 spikes, the average ISI is 0.\n",
    "    *   `firing_rate`: The overall firing rate in Hz (total spikes divided by duration). If the duration is 0, the firing rate is 0.\n",
    "3.  **Return a Dictionary:** Create a dictionary containing the calculated metrics with descriptive keys (e.g., 'num_spikes', 'duration', 'average_isi', 'firing_rate').\n",
    "4.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Make sure your function handles cases where the `spike_times` list is empty or contains only one spike. In these cases, the relevant metrics should be 0 or an empty list where appropriate.\n",
    "5.  **Test your function:** Call your `analyze_spike_data` function with a few different example lists of spike times (including cases with no spikes, one spike, and multiple spikes) and print the resulting dictionaries to verify your calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define the class:** create an empty neuron class. Add a docstring to keep the code documented and think at the overall overview of the class. A docstring is comment block that starts and ends with `\"\"\"`, for example\n",
    "\n",

    "class Neuron\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the docstring write down the **attributes** of the class together with the expected type: 1) an index which can be used ad an identifier for the cell 2) weights that are input to the neuron 3) a firing_threshold which is the activation threshold (after sigmoid) required to fire (between 0 and 1) 4) refractory_duration_s representing the minimal time interval (seconds) that elapse before the neuron can fire again 5) last_fire_time which is the timestamp of the last firing (`None` or `0` if never fired). In the docstring write down also the **methods** of the class. The methods are the following: weighted_sum, sigmoid, ready_to_fire, fire, process_inputs. We are going to write these methods one by one durin the exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Write the `__init__` method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is the *constructor* of the class. It runs automatically whenever a new `Neuron` object is created, and it sets up the object’s initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our constructor will take the following parameters:\n",
    "- `index` (int): an identifier for the neuron.  \n",
    "- `weights` (np.ndarray): the input weights of the neuron.  \n",
    "- `firing_threshold` (float, default = 0.5): the activation threshold after the sigmoid function.\n",
    "- - The `firing_threshold` must be between 0 and 1 so you will need to add a logic to constraint wrong values input to the constructor (if < 0 set it to zero or if > 1 set it to 1>). Make sure to provide a warning to the user.\n",
    "- `refractory_duration_s` (float, default = 0.5): the minimal time interval (in seconds) before the neuron can fire again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the constructor we will also define:\n",
    "- `last_fire_time` (float): initialized to `0.0`, meaning the neuron has never fired yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Write the `weighted_sum` method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our neuron will receive a set of **inputs**, just like a biological neuron receives signals through its **dendrites**.  \n",
    "Each input has an associated **weight**, which represents the strength (or importance) of that connection.  \n",
    "To combine these signals, we **multiply each input by its weight and then sum everything together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is called the **weighted sum** and is mathematically defined as:\n",

    "The length of this array **must match** the number of weights defined when creating the neuron (each input is paired with exactly one weight).  \n",
    "The function then multiplies each input by its corresponding weight and sums all the products together.  \n",
    "This operation produces the **weighted sum**, which represents the total input signal received by the neuron.\n",

    "After computing the weighted sum, we need to **evaluate** it s value on a function that describe if the neuron is firing or not.\n",
    "For this we use the **sigmoid function**, which always produces an output strictly between 0 and 1. \n",

    "A neuron should only fire if the **refractory period** has passed since its last firing time.  \n",
    "Define a class method called `ready_to_fire` (only parameter: `self`).  \n",

    "- Compare this elapsed time to the neuron's `refractory_duration_s`.  \n",

    "This method decides whether the neuron produces an output spike.  \n",
    "Define a method named `fire` that takes a single value representing the `weighted_sum` as input.  \n",

    "Inside this method:  \n",
    "- Apply the `sigmoid` function to compute the activation.  \n",
    "- Check if two conditions are both satisfied: the activation is greater than `firing_threshold` **AND** the neuron is `ready_to_fire()`.  \n",
