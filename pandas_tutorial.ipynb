    "## Pandas\n",
    "In this part of the lesson we are going to present one of the tools you will most likely use for .\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) defines and makes use of a new _data structure_, _i.e._ the `DataFrame`. \n",
    "Actually pandas define more than just a data structure, for instance we will make use of `Series` and examine the difference with dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists use Pandas for its following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easily handles missing data;\n",
    "* It provides an efficient way to slice the data;\n",
    "* It provides a flexible way to merge, concatenate or reshape the data;\n",
    "* It includes a powerful data casting tool to work with;\n",
    "* It wraps data visualisation libraries in order to quickly plotting analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tthe main disadvantage of pandas is that it is relegated to manipulate dataframes whose dimension is strictly lower than memory.\n",
    "### Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "A `DataFrame` is a table. As any other type in python, it is defined as a class, with its attributes and methods. \n",
    "You can check the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) to see the class APIs and see it s capability\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, it is a rank-$2$ array, with axes labelled as _rows_ and _columns_.\n",
    "It is the basic object in pandas and a really common way to load data in memory in order to operate on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the question you are all wondering: how to _create a dataframe_. There are several ways, by tuples, by lists, by numpy arrays or even by dictionaries. \n",
    "As a first instance, let's consider a list of names corresponding to people and their age, you can create a data frame in this way:"
