    "Data visualization should be the starting point of every analysis. It's often undervalued, with the belief that statistical analysis alone is sufficient.\n",
    "However, the significance of visualizing data is exemplified by [Anscome's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).\n",
    "DCreated by Francis J. Anscombe in 1973, this consists of four datasets.\n",
    "Each dataset yields identical summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and correlation), suggesting they are similar.\n",
    "Yet, when these datasets are graphically represented, their differences become apparent.\n",
    "The key aspect of Anscombe's Quartet lies not in having four datasets with identical statistical properties, but in how these visually distinct datasets reveal those same properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years more similar datasets have been created to show the importance of data visualization:\n",
    "one of those is the Datasaurus dataset which urges people to \"never trust summary statistics alone; always visualize your data\", since, while the data exhibits normal seeming statistics, plotting the data reveals a picture of a dinosaur ðŸ¦–.\n",
    "Inspired by Anscombe's Quartet, the Datasaurus you can download found in the original publication the [_datasaurus dozen_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025912 \n",
    "), _i.e._ 13 datasets (the Datasaurus + $12$ others) having the same summary statistics up to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the golden rule is the following one.\n",
    "> Always find a nice way to visualise your data before going into applying the statistics.\n",
